 * labels fully displayed, while unfocussed elements are usually subject to the current label
 * management strategy. Focussed / unfocussed elements can be distinguished by checking their
 * {@link KlighdLabelProperties#ELEMENT_IN_FOCUS}.
 * 
 * <p>This class does not set the focussed state on the clicked element only, but also determines
 * which other elements should change their focus state along with it. A simple example would be
 * the ports of a node: if the node is focussed, labels of ports should usually be focussed as
 * well. Subclasses can override the {@link #determineFocussedElements(KGraphElement)} method to
 * determine what should change focus with a given element.</p>
