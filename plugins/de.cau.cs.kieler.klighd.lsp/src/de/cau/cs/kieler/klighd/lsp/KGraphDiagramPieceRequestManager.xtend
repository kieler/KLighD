     * is that a piece may only be requested after some of its children have also already been generated.
     * This doesn't happen in the current implementation, because the client will only request pieces
     * in a strict top-down order, however in the case in the future that the client should have some
     * more advanced piece management capabilities including removal of pieces that are not required 
     * at that time to save space for example in the case of very large graphs, it becomes relevant to
     * actually only send the requested piece and not an entire graph that is dangling from it as well.
     * The cost of this lies on the server (copying and trimming data) and remains to be analyzed and implemented.
